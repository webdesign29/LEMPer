# [L]inux [E]ngine-X [M]ariaDB [P]HP Install[ER]

LEMPer stands for Linux, Engine-X (Nginx), MariaDB and PHP installer written in Bash script. This is just a small tool set (a bunch collection of scripts) that usually I use to deploy and manage Debian-based/Ubuntu LEMP stack. LEMPer is _ServerPilot_, _CloudWays_, _RunCloud_, _WordOps_, and _EasyEngine_ alternative crafted to support wide-range PHP framework (not only WordPress).

## Setting Up

* Ensure that you have git installed.
* Make a copy of .env.dist to .env in the LEMPer base directory and replace the values.
* Enter LEMPer directory.
* Execute lemper.sh file, ```sudo ./lemper.sh --install```.

### Installing LEMP stack

```bash
sudo apt-get install git && git clone -q https://github.com/webdesign29/LEMPer.git && cd LEMPer && cp -f .env.dist .env && sudo ./lemper.sh --install
```

### Removing LEMP stack

```bash
sudo ./lemper.sh --remove
```

## LEMPer Command Line Administration Tool

LEMPer comes with friendly command line tool which will make your LEMP stack administration much easier. These command line tool called Lemper CLI (lemper-cli) for creating new virtual host and managing existing LEMP stack.

### lemper-cli Usage

Add/create new virtual host

```bash
sudo lemper-cli create -u username -d example.app -f default -w /home/username/Webs/example.app
```

Manage/update existing virtual host

```bash
sudo lemper-cli manage --enable-fastcgi-cache example.app
```

for more help

```bash
sudo lemper-cli --help
```

Note: Lemper CLI will automagically add a new PHP-FPM user's pool configuration if it doesn't exists. You must add the user account first.
